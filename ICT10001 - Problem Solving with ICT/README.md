# ICT10001 - Problem Solving with ICT

Welcome to ICT10001 Problem Solving with ICT.

Every day we are faced with problems that require analytical thinking, creativity and resourcefulness to solve. This unit challenges you to explore different approaches to analysing and solving problems in an organisation framework. You will develop the ability to apply analysis techniques to unfamiliar problems and present your investigation through the use of a wide range of innovative Information Communication Technologies (ICT), including prototyping, cloud-based tools, report writing and presentations. In addition, you are encouraged to reflect upon your learning throughout the unit.
