#COS200019

Welcome to COS20019 - Cloud Computing Architecture. The overall aim of this unit is to use a cloud platform to create web-based distributed applications that are secure, scalable, reliable and cost optimized. We will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for this unit. 

By the end of this unit you should be able to:

Explain the principles and value of cloud computing
Create and manage cloud services using a cloud management platform
Implement and deploy a cloud-based web site that is reliable, scalable, secure and cost effective
Research available cloud services, then design and justify an architectural solution that uses these services
