COS10003 - Computer &amp; Logic Essentials for Swinburne University of Technology

Computer and Logic Essentials is a one semester unit for which we expect year 11 maths competency as a pre-requisite; we recognise that many of you have more maths exposure and we are trying to cater for a larger range of backgrounds.

The overall aim of this unit is to introduce students to fundamental mathematical concepts required in computer science and software development disciplines, thus, by the end of this unit you should be able to solve problems using discrete mathematical concepts such as sets, relations, functions, logic, and combinatorics, understand basic circuits, understand how probability and statistics are important for computer science, and most importantly construct algorithms to solve problems and understand the principles of complexity. These topics will all return and be developed further in later units.
